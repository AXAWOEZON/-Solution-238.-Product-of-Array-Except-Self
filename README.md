This code solves the problem of computing an array answer, where each element answer[i] is the product of all elements of the array nums except nums[i].

To achieve this, the code follows these steps:

Initialization: Three arrays are initialized:

left: This array holds the product of all elements of nums located to the left of nums[i].
right: This array holds the product of all elements of nums located to the right of nums[i].
answer: This array is initialized with ones.
Compute left array:

A loop iterates over the elements of left, starting from the second element (left[1]), since left[0] is always 1.
For each element left[i], the product of all elements of nums located to the left of nums[i] is calculated and stored in left[i].
Compute right array:

Another loop iterates over the elements of right, starting from the second-to-last element down to the first one inclusively (right[i - 2] to right[0]).
For each element right[i], the product of all elements of nums located to the right of nums[i] is calculated and stored in right[i].
Compute answer array:

Finally, a loop iterates over the elements of answer.
For each element answer[i], the product of the corresponding elements left[i] and right[i] is calculated and stored in answer[i].
By following this approach, the code computes the desired answer array, where each element is the product of all elements of nums except the corresponding element in linear time complexity, without using division.
